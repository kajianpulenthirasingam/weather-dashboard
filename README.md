# Kajian Weather Dashboard
Website Made by Kajian Pulenthirasingam

My first Weather dashboard. I had the challenge of making my first weather dashboard. Enter the city for the current weather and its 5 day forecast. It will tell you the weather condition with pictures. There is a search history option on the bottom of the page that tells you what you have searched before. I used the https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 to get the API key to make this code function. For installing my project you just need to clone this code to your repository.
